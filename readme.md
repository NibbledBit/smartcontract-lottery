# Smart Contract Lottery

### Specification

1. Users can enter lottery with ETH based on USD fee
2. An Admin will choose when lottery is over
3. The lottery will select a random winner

### Notes

Point 2 within the specification means this project is not truly decentralised.

Ways to resolve this would be:

- Use a timing/counting algorithm (draw once weekly, draw once a certain value has been reached)
- DAO could be the admin
- Chainlink Keepers
